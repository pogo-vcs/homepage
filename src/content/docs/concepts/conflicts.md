description: Understanding and resolving conflicts in Pogo
---

Pogo treats conflicts as first-class citizens, allowing you to push conflicted changes and resolve them when convenient. This approach reduces merge anxiety and enables more flexible collaboration.

## Philosophy

Traditional version control systems block progress when conflicts occur. Pogo takes a different approach:

- **Push with conflicts**: Continue working even with unresolved conflicts
- **Defer resolution**: Resolve conflicts when you have time and context
- **Collaborate on conflicts**: Others can help resolve conflicts
- **Clear tracking**: Always know what conflicts exist

## How Conflicts Occur

Conflicts happen when:

1. Two changes modify the same part of a file differently
2. One change deletes a file another modifies
3. Binary files are changed in incompatible ways
4. Directory structure changes conflict

### Example Scenario

```
main (abc123): "Hello, World!"
  â”œâ”€â”€ change1 (def456): "Hello, Pogo!"
  â””â”€â”€ change2 (ghi789): "Hi, World!"
```

Merging change1 and change2 creates a conflict.

## Conflict Markers

Pogo uses standard conflict markers in text files:

```
<<<<<<<<< A
Hello, Pogo!
=========
Hi, World!
>>>>>>>>> B
```

### Marker Components

- `<<<<<<<<<`: Start of first change
- `=========` Separator between changes
- `>>>>>>>>>`: Start of second change

## Working with Conflicts

### Detecting Conflicts

Log shows if there are conflicts in a change:

```bash
pogo log
```

### Pushing with Conflicts

```bash
# Pogo allows pushing conflicted changes
pogo push

# Server accepts and stores conflicts
# Other users can see conflicts exist
```

This enables:

- Saving work in progress
- Sharing problems with team
- Continuing other work
- Collaborative resolution

## Resolving Conflicts

### Manual Resolution

1. **Open conflicted file**

```bash
nvim conflicted-file.txt
```

2. **Choose or combine versions**

```
# Keep current version
Hello, Pogo!

# Or keep incoming
Hi, World!

# Or combine
Hello, Pogo World!
```

3. **Remove conflict markers**

```
<<<<<<<<<
=========
>>>>>>>>>
```

4. **Save and push**

```bash
pogo push
```

## Conflict Types

### Text File Conflicts

Text merge can be performed on any unicode text file (UTF-8, UTF-16 LE, UTF-16 BE, UTF-32 LE, UTF-32 BE). On conflict you will get the Git conflict markers you are used to.

### Binary File Conflicts

When binary files conflict, You will get all of the files. They are renamed to signal the conflict and where each file came from.

### Semantic Conflicts

Code that doesn't conflict textually but breaks:

- Function signature changes
- Incompatible logic changes
- No automatic detection
- Requires testing to find

Pogo doesn't notice semantic conflicts, you will need other ways to find them.

## Best Practices

### Prevention

**Communicate Changes**

- Describe changes clearly
- Coordinate on shared files
- Push frequently

**Modular Code**

- Small, focused files
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal overlap between features

### During Conflicts

**Don't Panic**

- Conflicts are normal
- Take time to understand
- Ask for help if needed: collaborative merging

**Understand Context**

- Read both versions fully
- Understand the intent
- Consider the bigger picture

**Test After Resolution**

- Ensure code still works
- Run test suite
- Check for semantic conflicts

### Team Workflows

**Conflict Owner**

- Person who creates merge owns resolution
- Can delegate to subject expert
- Documents resolution reasoning

### Cascading Conflicts

Conflicts can propagate:

```
main -> feature1 (conflict) -> feature2 (inherits conflict)
```

### Conflict Recovery

If resolution goes wrong:

```bash
# Revert to pre-resolution state
pogo edit previous-change

# Start fresh
pogo new

# Try different resolution
```

## Conflict Status

### Visual Indicators

Pogo uses clear indicator: ðŸ’¥ emoji in log when conflicts exist

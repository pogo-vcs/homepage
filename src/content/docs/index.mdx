## Key Features

- **No Named Branches**: Create branches by creating a child change
- **Automatic Naming**: Changes are automatically named - no need to think about branch names
- **Bookmarks**: Tag versions with meaningful names like `main` or `v1.0.0` - a bookmark replaces branches and tags you know from Git
- **Go Module Support**: Import repositories directly as Go modules
- **Simple Web UI**: Browse repositories easily through the built-in web interface
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic cleanup of unreachable data

## Workflow Philosophy

Pogo promotes a simple, efficient workflow:

1. **Describe First**: Think about and document changes before implementation.
2. **Work Iteratively**: Work on changes iteratively and update the description if needed.
3. **Branch Naturally**: Instead of creating brnaches with fixed naming rules, just create a child change that inherits the parent. Merge by creating a change with more than one parent.
4. **Bookmark Important Versions**: Use bookmarks to mark releases and milestones. Use the `main` bookmark se identify your current development state.

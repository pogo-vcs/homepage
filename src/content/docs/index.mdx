## Workflow Philosophy

Pogo promotes a simple, efficient workflow:

1. **Describe First**: Think about and document changes before implementation.
2. **Work Iteratively**: Work on changes iteratively and update the description if needed.
3. **Branch Naturally**: Instead of creating branches with fixed naming rules, just create a child change that inherits the parent. Merge by creating a change with more than one parent.
4. **Bookmark Important Versions**: Use bookmarks to mark releases and milestones. Use the `main` bookmark se identify your current development state.

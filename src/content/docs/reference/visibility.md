description: Set repository visibility to public or private

Set the repository's visibility to either public or private.

Public repositories can be accessed by anyone, while private repositories
require explicit access grants. Only users with access to the repository
can change its visibility.

## Usage

```bash
pogo visibility
```

## Examples

```bash
# Make repository public
pogo visibility public

# Make repository private
pogo visibility private
```
